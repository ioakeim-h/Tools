The script contains two functions: column_search and value_search

The column_search function takes a Pandas DataFrame df, a string col representing the name of a column in the DataFrame, and an optional score_cutoff parameter. The function searches the DataFrame for columns that closely match the col argument using the process.extract method from the rapidfuzz library. The extract method takes a query string, a list of choices to match against, and a score cutoff below which matches will be ignored. The function then prints the results, which are a list of tuples containing the matched column name and the score (a float between 0 and 100) indicating the similarity between the query and the matched column name.

The value_search function takes a Pandas Series col and a string value. The function uses the process.extractOne method from the rapidfuzz library to search for a string in the col Series that closely matches the value argument. The extractOne method returns a tuple containing the matched string and the score indicating the similarity between the query and the matched string. The fuzz.ratio scorer is used to calculate the similarity score, which is a value between 0 and 100.
