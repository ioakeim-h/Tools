This script is useful for anyone who needs to gather information about the files stored in a particular set of directories, and can be adapted to work with different sets of directories and file types.

It uses the pandas and os libraries to create a dataframe containing all files and their sizes in a set of directories. It begins by creating an empty dataframe with columns for file name, size, and directory path. The script then loops through each directory and obtains a list of files, and for each file, retrieves its name, size, and directory path, and appends these values to the dataframe using the loc function. Finally, the resulting dataframe is saved as an Excel file.
